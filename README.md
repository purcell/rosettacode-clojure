Rosettacode task solutions in clojure
=====================================

This is a set of personal Clojure solutions to the
[rosettacode tasks](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code), some of
which have been included on the Rosetta Code wiki itself.

The code was written with the intention of learning more Clojure
rather than collecting a full set of canonical solutions in one
repository.
